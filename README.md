# 🌌 Nova AI — Next Generation Observation and Visualization with AI
**Nova AI** is an intelligent system that uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze NASA satellite data and detect exoplanets with high accuracy.  
It combines scientific precision with an educational web platform, making space research accessible for both scientists and the public.
---
## 🚀 Overview
Nova AI was developed during the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** by a team from **Tajikistan** — 2 teachers and 4 students (grades 8–10).  
The project aims to make space data analysis faster and smarter while inspiring the next generation of researchers.
> “Nova AI is more than a model — it’s a step toward making space research open to everyone.”
